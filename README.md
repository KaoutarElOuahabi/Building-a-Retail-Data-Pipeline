# **Retail Data Pipeline Project**  

This project is designed to demonstrate the structure and organization of a professional data pipeline. It adheres to best practices for real-world projects, showcasing how robust, scalable, and maintainable solutions are implemented in the data engineering domain.  

---



## **Overview**  
The Retail Data Pipeline processes sales data by integrating multiple sources, applying business logic, and delivering clean, analysis-ready datasets. It is built to be modular and efficient, ensuring flexibility for scaling and adaptability to new data sources.  

---

## **Key Features**  
- **Data Integration:** Combines PostgreSQL database entries with external Parquet files.
- **Clean Transformations:** Applies transformations for structured and accurate results.
- **Professional Design:** A clear, modular structure that reflects real-world workflows.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Tracks every step for transparency and debugging.
- **Execution Time:** The entire data pipeline executes in X minutes, including extraction, transformation, and loading phases.

## **Why This Structure?**  
This project demonstrates my respect for industry-standard practices in the following ways:  
1. **Organization**: The directory structure makes it easy to extend and navigate the project.  
2. **Reusability**: Code is modular and reusable across different projects.  
3. **Transparency**: Comprehensive logging and clear documentation provide insight into every step.  
4. **Simplicity & Scalability**: The design balances simplicity with room for future growth.  

If you’re familiar with how professionals organize their work, you’ll find this project intuitive and aligned with those principles.

## **Setup**  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/KaoutarElOuahabi/Building-a-Retail-Data-Pipeline.git
   cd retail-data-pipeline  
   ```  

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv DataEnginner  
   source DataEnginner/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS  
   DataEnginner\Scripts\activate    # Windows  
   ```  

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

4. **Update Configuration**  
   Set database credentials and file paths in `config/settings.py`:  
   ```python  
   DB_CONFIG = {  
       'user': ' ',  
       'password': ' ' ,  
       'host': ' ',  
       'port': ,  
       'database': ''  
   }  
   ```  

---

## **Running the Pipeline**  
Run the ETL pipeline with:  
```bash  
python run_pipeline.py  
```  
This will:  
1. Extract data from the PostgreSQL database.  
2. Merge with external Parquet files.  
3. Apply transformations and export the output to `data/output`.
